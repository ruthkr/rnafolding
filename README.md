**rnafolding** is a package to predict RNA scructures thermodynamically using a sliding-windows approach and plot them.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ruthkr/rnafolding")
```

<!-- ## Documentation -->

<!-- To use `rnafolding`, you can read the documentation on the following topics: -->

<!-- 1. [Getting started](https://ruthkr.github.io/rnafolding/articles/overview.html) -->

## Quick start

This is a basic example which shows you how to run windowed folding from a FASTA file:

``` r
# Load the package
library(rnafolding)

# Define the FASTA path from the sample 5S rRNA sequence
seq_5S <- system.file("extdata", "5S.fasta", package = "rnafolding")

# Fold 5S with Sliding Windows
windows_5S <- rnafolding::fold(
  filename = seq_5S,
  winsize = 50,
  stepsize = 5
)
```

*Note that you need to get the RNAfold tool from the VienaRNA package in your PATH variable. Otherwise you can use the `rnafold_dir` argument from the `fold()` function to specify it.*

After getting the windowed folding results, you can plot the structure map as follows:

``` r
plot_structure_map(
  windows_5S,
  plot_list = c("entropy", "bpp")
)
```
